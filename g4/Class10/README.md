# Jedi Archives - pt. 2

## Tasks for the second part of our application

This is a continuation of the app that we've bulit on our first workshop (that means we will work on the same code). The tasks for this part are the following:

- The requests should be (re)done using the await/async syntax.
- Add a loader to the UI while the user waits for the data
- Add a pagination that displays the number of the current page
- Add sort functionality that sorts the columns in an ascending or descending order (this can be achieved on clicking the column name or by selecting an option from a dropdown)
- Add search (without a button) that filters by name
Bonus:
- Add a delete button on each row that will delete the row
